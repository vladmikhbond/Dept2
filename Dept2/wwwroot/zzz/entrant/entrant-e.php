<p>Software development is an engineering discipline related to all aspects of software production from the initial stages of creating a specification  to providing a support system after commissioning.</p>
<p>The programming industry is one of the most promising and dynamic areas. Modern IT companies offer interesting projects, career development and competitive salary. Forecasts of economic development of the area in our country are constrained by lack of qualified human resources. </p>
<p>Education in the field of software engineering is a wise investment in your future. You will learn not only programming (coding), but also how to create software products — analyze requirements, interact in a development team, test and ensure product quality, and manage software projects.</p>
<p>The Department of Software Engineering has a licensed admission for 355 people for the preparation of bachelors in the specialty 121 “Software Engineering” (educational program “Software Engineering”).</p>
<p>Students have an ample opportunity for choosing various disciplines. Some subjects are taught in English in separately formed groups.
<p>Starting from the 3rd year, students undergo practical training at the leading IT companies in Kharkiv and Ukraine. A cooperation agreement between the Department of Software Engineering of NURE and Global Logic, NIX Solutions, EPAM Systems and Sigma Software companies allowed to create software development laboratories at the Department. 
<p>We practiсe engaging leading experts of companies to the teaching of professionally-oriented disciplines and preparing senior students in the form of free optional classes from companies.
<p>During studying, students improve their professional level, participate in seminars and clubs organized on the basis of scientific laboratories, laboratory “Programmer”(where students receive knowledge and skills in solving problems to prepare for different competitions),  laboratory GameDev (where students are prepared to develop game projects) and participate in the project “IT Talents” (advanced studying of complex algorithms with their practical implementation in various IT areas). 
<p>Students of the software engineering department repeatedly won at Ukrainian and international programming competitions, honourably represented the department and the university at exhibitions, contests, conferences and forums.
